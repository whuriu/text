from an anime yo onizuka gang got me imagining myself if i was in an 90s outro walking in a grass field ahh what a familiar but unique feeling thanks for this playlist i remember back in the days and i imagine myself that just keeps on walking on a one fine day you got yourself a new subscriber needed this to look out the window and wonder why i tugged my meat 3 times today горшка конечно красиво нарисовали lets be honest the only way we all clicked on the video is because of reccomendations my name is ota noritada im 27 years old i was born in harima province i do not have a wife or kids i work as a swordsmith in my own store and i get home every day by 9 pm at the latest i dont drink but i occasionally smoke im in bed by 11 pm and i make sure to get 8 hours of sleep no matter what after having a glass of milk an working out for 35 minutes nonstop i have no problems in sleeping until the morning just like a baby i wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning but my life wasnt always like this when i was just 8 years old i had to fight tigers wolves and bears bare handed when i was 18 i had to fight to defend my town from invaders and to restore our freedom but today im simply a man that wishes to live a quiet life i do not trouble myself with any enemies i just want to live my own life but let me tell you if i have to fight again heads will roll i am sitting in my room at 1 in the morning i have school today and need to study this playlist is making it possible dont forget that you are the protagonist of your own life its easy to get lost in what other people have but only you can live your life and make your story i hope for everyone reading this that its a happy one really nice music any way to find the picture of the video this makes me go why did i put this on the first one is like the best if you are not turning your gaze into the sky every once in a while what is the point of having a gaze this music mix makes me feel some typa way its so hard to explain like everything in my life is meaningless just for a moment in that moment i stared in nothingness looking for something what is that something i dont know the answer to that right now what i do know is that something is worth working towards until i find that something i must not quit i must keep going i owe it to myself whenever i feeling down i remember this for if i dont achieve that something i have no one else to blame but myself typing indeed this music that made me want to look up at the sky like a protagonist this playlist would be absolutely perfect for a roadtrip across alaska or something i wish i was the embodiment of my admiration i do consciously knowing its not who i am to be my dream eludes me because of my own discretion despite this towards my end im optimistic yet brazen in my unforeseeable results with and against my selfs goal my hope will carry me regardless devaughn hall jr i knew just from the theme of this playlist that nujabes would be included ive won but at what cost ahh playlist this is my last day at a teaching job and im kinda stressing out because of a clearance that maybe just a list of bills a simple return of some things or something worst that will be a pain but this music calmed me down thanks im high as shit and yo these music has me like viewing shit in the 7 person and flying into the sky this music helped me read the bible and think of how i used to want to be a protagonist this playlist is actually perfect just playing overwatch late at night vibing to this i almost looked up at the roof lmao tetsuo wow i felt like the protagonist bruh something im desperately searching forthank you you have my gratitude i get so much k project vibes i too now feel like a samurai chillin on the side of a grassy hill with a grass blade coming out of my mouth while the wind is softly blowing and the sky is ever so blue while listening to this i noticed that so many of these songs are actually samples in other songs i love how cool im still a side character but thats okay the first song is so good man i am now look to sky feeling i have to go train to a battle against my first oponent in a anime and this song will be playing until my training ends keep the faith nomak is my fav y all are fucking cringers everyone is the main character of his own life the thing is that you decide what role you play on it i drove with the gas light on to this playlist good times nujabes doesnt have a single bad song bro this makes me nostalgic for the lonely summers spent in 19th century japan being a lone samurai with a tragic past wrote a poem to this playlist while listening on the toilet through valleys in the storm chasing shadows like a worm traveling swiftly and always down ejecting from me poop soft and brown i hope you ejoyed w bro what are these stupid elevator music i wonder how people enjoy this love playlists like these cus i find out about new artists so its my turn ive met a girl on the internet and we were friends well it was on off in bursts of interest and it was fun but always faded after a month or two well this time weve gotten pretty close i guess but well she felt like i maybe sorta kinda am into her well i was but i thought it was best to talk about it and friendship is not less than a romantic relation to me so it was just something to talk about we talked about meeting and well she said ok but there was constant postponing lack of contact and it felt to me like she just didnt really want toshe has avoidant attachment issues so it was a litle harder to know 100 but after some time it was ultra weird well it got to a point where it was very unpleasant for me i felt ignored pushed away i gave her space as she wanted but she didnt try to maintain contact so it saddened me more when the day before the meeting came we didnt talk about what we would do she was super weird about it all the time the postponing was also pretty weird she texted about it and i just couldnt bring myself to even respond we practically didnt even talk for like 2 weeks and i felt it was super forced half a day went then she responded and i broke the news that it feels absolutely awkward and she behaves like she doesnt want to do it and many other things what i got as response was that she felt i was into her but didnt want to guess or make it awkward so she didnt say anything and just started distancing herself to signal that she didnt want it that way her explanation was trauma from highschool with a friend that was so angry after rejection that he started spreading gossip about her so here i am not sure to trust her again between anger for treating my feelings like we were in preschool and empathy for her situation its just hard im not really hateful but after all my engagementemotional support and compassion i was treated like a toy and that bugs me because i really like her as a person but i know this person is very dangerous and i cant trust her or keep her around im just sad thank you for this my english is not good but i want to send to the creator that this playlist make me accept all the traumatic experiences also make me feel better after she left me and we both became strangerit hurts me a lottt when you fall in love with the antagonist thanks man ive been listening to this playlist a lot while studying and relaxing this means a lot to me thank you reminds me of when i took a walk outside one day and felt gods presence so strongly the sun was shining brightly the autumn leaves were all falling down in front of me as i walked back to my house birds were chirping the clouds were in full effect the wind was chilly but not too cold thats god peace unconditional love natural and unadulterated beauty and grace ever since i became a christian i look at every little thing with appreciation and gratitude that day i felt so small and yet so comforted and loved this playlist is a blessing nomak witness and nujabes really threw down some bangers regardless of who you are or what you experienced you will one day look at the beautiful sky and realise how meaningless your struggles really are in that deep emptiness of blue and clouds that move for eternity i sit back and leave myself for a moment but somewhere my heart will feel at peace of where i am the sky the art work is from a manga series called vagabond derrick christ rose do you have a sound cloud i would love to listen to this while in class vagabond sss tier perfect compilation for my horror sketches accept everything just the way it is do not seek pleasure for its own sake do not under any circumstances depend on a partial feeling think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world never be jealous do not regret what you have done be detached from desire your whole life long miamoto musashi arigato thank you very much thanks beautiful you have quite the taste in music my soul left my body and enjoys in heaven starting of song this beat
