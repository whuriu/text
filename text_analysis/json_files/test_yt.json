But my life wasn't always like this, when I was just 8 years old I had to fight tigers, wolves, and bears bare handed. When I was 18 I had to fight to defend my town from invaders and to restore our freedom. But today I'm simply a man that wishes to live a quiet life.

Well this time we've gotten pretty close i guess, but well she felt like i maybe sorta kinda am into her (well, i was but i thought it was best to talk about it and friendship is not less than a romantic relation to me so it was just something to talk about), we talked about meeting and well she said ok, but there was constant postponing, lack of contact and it felt to me like she just didn't really want to,(she has avoidant attachment issues so it was a litle harder to know 100%, but after some time it was ultra weird).\n Well it got to a point where it was very unpleasant for me, i felt ignored, pushed away. I gave her space as she wanted but she didn't try to maintain contact so it saddened me more. \nWhen the day before the meeting came (we didn't talk about what we would do she was super weird about it all the time, the postponing was also pretty weird) she texted about it and I just couldn't bring myself to even respond, we practically didn't even talk for like 2 weeks and I felt it was super forced. \nHalf a day went then she responded and I broke the news that it feels absolutely awkward and she behaves like she doesn't want to do it and many other things. \nWhat I got as response was that she felt i was into her, but didn't want to guess or make it awkward so she didn't say anything and just started distancing herself to SIGNAL that she didn't want it that way. \nHer explanation was trauma from highschool with a friend that was so angry after rejection that he started spreading gossip about her.\nSo here I am, not sure to trust her again, between anger for treating my feelings like we were in preschool and empathy for her situation. \nIt's just hard, im not really hateful, but after all my engagement,emotional support and compassion I was treated like a toy and that bugs me, because I really like her as a person but I know this person is very dangerous and I can't trust her or keep her around.\nIm just sad."},{"id":"UgyhSnJyb4aerPguVyJ4AaABAg","date":"2024-02-20T07:02:32Z","actor":"@SojuStay","text":"Thank you for this"},{"id":"UgzNL2TP8RZ-Nh2ZmYR4AaABAg","date":"2024-02-18T12:56:58Z","actor":"@midk-dg8hz","text":"my english is not good, but i want to send to the creator that this playlist make me accept all the traumatic experiences, also make me feel better          ( after she left me and we both became stranger*it hurts me a lotT-T*)"},{"id":"UgyTOQ8QYWeGBQ-Bs2Z4AaABAg","date":"2024-02-11T17:01:41Z","actor":"@OldFashionedWisdom","text":"when you fall in love with the antagonist:"},{"id":"UgzA1ogARuWPio84UxR4AaABAg","date":"2024-02-07T09:08:37Z","actor":"@Aice-rj1wz","text":"Thanks, man!
